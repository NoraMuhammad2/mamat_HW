1: In our code we did repeat some code, for example: in median function we used code lines that we wrote in histogram function
we used the code of histogram function with nbins=100 , in order to decrase the repetiton we should have called the histogram function
 with nbins =100.
In min and max functions we repeated the code the only difference was the two paramters min and max and the if cases in the two
functions, in order to decrase the repetiton we should have used the same function for min and max and , for example using the min function 
and adding max parmater and a new if case to it.
2: answer: yes the grades that we choose are uniformly divided. in order to check this we can use the median function: by giving the median 
function random grades we will see that the median is close to 50.so half of the grades are smaller than 50 and the other numbers are bigger 
than 50 , in other words there is no preference between the grades so our grades are uniformly divided.
